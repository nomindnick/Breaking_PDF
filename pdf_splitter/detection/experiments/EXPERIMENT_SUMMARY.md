# Detection Experiments Summary

## Current Status (2025-01-03)

### ‚úÖ What's Working
- **Simple transition detection**: 100% recall on document boundaries
- **Text extraction**: Successfully extracting text from OCR'd PDFs
- **Performance**: 3x faster with simplified approach (5s vs 14s per page)
- **Infrastructure**: Experiment framework and Ollama integration working well

### üéØ Best Approach So Far
```python
# Simple prompt focusing on page transitions
prompt = f"""Your task is to determine if two document snippets are part of a single document or are different documents.

You will be given the bottom part of Page 1 and the top portion of Page 2. Your task is to determine whether Page 1 and Page 2 are part of a single document or if Page 1 is the end of one document and Page 2 is the start of a new document.

Please only respond with "Same Document" or "Different Documents"

Bottom of Page 1:
{page1_bottom}

Top of Page 2:
{page2_top}"""
```

**Results**: 100% recall, 50% precision, F1=0.667

### üìä Key Metrics
| Approach | Model | Recall | Precision | F1 | Speed |
|----------|-------|--------|-----------|-----|-------|
| Complex context | phi4-mini | 0% | N/A | 0.000 | 14s/page |
| Simple transition | phi4-mini | 100% | 50% | 0.667 | 5s/page |

### üîç Why Simple Works Better
1. **Focused on the boundary** - Only looks at page transition, not full context
2. **Clear binary choice** - "Same/Different" vs complex JSON reasoning
3. **Less confusion** - Model doesn't overthink continuity

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Issues
- **False positives**: Model treats page breaks as document boundaries
- **Performance**: Still 2.5x slower than <2s target
- **No confidence scoring**: Binary yes/no without nuance

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

### 1. Test Other Models
```bash
# Quick test script available:
python pdf_splitter/detection/experiments/working_simple_approach.py
```

### 2. Refine Prompt
- Add false positive hints
- Test few-shot examples
- Try different context sizes (200-400 chars)

### 3. Two-Pass Approach
- First pass: High recall detection
- Second pass: Verify boundaries with more context

### 4. Performance Optimization
- Batch processing multiple transitions
- Test smaller/faster models
- Consider local inference

## Quick Start for Tomorrow
```bash
# Activate environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Run working baseline
python pdf_splitter/detection/experiments/working_simple_approach.py

# Test with different model
python pdf_splitter/detection/experiments/simple_boundary_test.py
```

## Remember
- **High recall > High precision** (users can merge, not split)
- **Simple prompts > Complex prompts**
- **Focus on the transition, not the pages**
