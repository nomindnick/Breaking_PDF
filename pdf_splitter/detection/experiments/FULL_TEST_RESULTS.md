# Full Performance Test Results - LLM Boundary Detection

## Test Overview

**Date**: January 4, 2025  
**Duration**: ~13 minutes  
**Models Tested**: phi4-mini:3.8b, gemma3:latest  
**Test Cases**: 26 synthetic cases across 10 difficulty levels  
**Total Evaluations**: 312 (26 cases × 6 prompts × 2 models)  

## Executive Summary

The comprehensive test revealed that Chain-of-Draft (CoD) prompts significantly outperform baseline approaches for boundary detection, achieving F1 scores up to 0.500. However, the optimal prompts (phi4_optimal, gemma3_optimal) were not tested due to a naming mismatch issue, and overall performance indicates substantial room for improvement.

## Key Findings

### 1. Chain-of-Draft Success
- CoD prompts (E1, E2) achieved the highest F1 scores
- E1_cod_reasoning showed perfect recall (100%) but low precision
- E2_cod_minimal offered better balance between precision and recall

### 2. Trade-offs Observed
- **High Recall vs Low Precision**: E1_cod_reasoning catches all boundaries but has many false positives
- **High Accuracy vs Low F1**: D1_conservative_few_shot is accurate overall but misses many true boundaries
- **Simplicity vs Performance**: Minimal CoD (E2) performed comparably to full CoD (E1)

### 3. Model Comparison
- Both models showed similar overall performance
- Gemma3 slightly outperformed Phi4 on CoD prompts
- Model-specific optimal prompts were not tested (naming issue)

### 4. Issues Identified

#### Critical Issues
1. **Optimal Prompts Not Tested**: Naming mismatch prevented testing of phi4_optimal and gemma3_optimal
2. **A1_asymmetric Failure**: Complete parsing failure, all predictions returned as "Unknown"

#### Performance Issues
1. **Low Overall F1 Scores**: Best F1 score of only 0.500 indicates significant room for improvement
2. **Conservative Bias**: Most prompts over-predict "Same" document
3. **Difficulty Scaling**: Performance degrades as test case difficulty increases

## Response Time Analysis

| Prompt Type | Avg Response Time |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Baseline (A1, D1) | 1.8-2.2 seconds |
| Chain-of-Draft (E1, E2) | 5.2-7.1 seconds |
| Optimal (not tested) | N/A |

The CoD prompts take 3-4x longer due to structured reasoning generation.

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Fix Naming Issue**: Update code to correctly load phi4_optimal and gemma3_optimal prompts
2. **Debug A1_asymmetric**: Investigate why responses aren't being parsed correctly
3. **Rerun Tests**: Test the optimal prompts which should theoretically perform best

### Prompt Engineering Improvements
1. **Reduce Conservative Bias**: Adjust prompts to better balance Same/Different predictions
2. **Refine CoD Format**: Optimize E1 prompt to maintain recall while improving precision
3. **Add Confidence Thresholds**: Implement B1/B2 style confidence scoring with CoD

### Testing Improvements
1. **Balance Dataset**: Ensure equal distribution of Same/Different cases
2. **Add Real PDF Validation**: Test winning prompts on actual documents
3. **Implement Constrained Generation**: Use proper logit masking for single-token outputs

## Conclusions

The comprehensive test demonstrates that:

1. **Chain-of-Draft prompting is effective** for boundary detection, achieving the best F1 scores
2. **Significant optimization potential exists**, especially with the untested optimal prompts
3. **Trade-offs between metrics** require careful consideration based on use case requirements
4. **Both models are viable**, with similar performance characteristics

The foundation is solid, but addressing the identified issues and testing the research-based optimal prompts should yield substantial improvements.

## Next Steps

1. Fix technical issues (naming, parsing)
2. Retest with optimal prompts included
3. Implement constrained generation for faster inference
4. Validate on real PDF documents
5. Consider ensemble approaches combining high-recall and high-precision prompts
