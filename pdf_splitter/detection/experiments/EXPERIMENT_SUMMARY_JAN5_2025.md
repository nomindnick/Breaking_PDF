# LLM Boundary Detection Experiment Summary

## Date: January 5, 2025

### Executive Summary

Through systematic experimentation with prompt engineering, we achieved:
- **F1 Score: 0.889** (balanced dataset) using gemma3_optimal prompt
- **100% Precision**: No false boundaries detected
- **85% Accuracy**: Reliable boundary detection

**Recommendation**: Use gemma3_optimal prompt with gemma3:latest model for production.

### Experiments Conducted

1. **Naming Fix**: Resolved phi_optimal → phi4_optimal issue
2. **Optimal Prompts Test**: Tested research-based prompts with XML structure
3. **Constrained Generation**: Implemented regex/JSON/XML constraints
4. **Balanced Dataset**: Re-tested with 50/50 Same/Different distribution

### Key Results

| Approach | F1 Score | Response Time | Notes |
|----------|----------|---------------|-------|
| gemma3_optimal (balanced) | **0.889** | ~33s | Best overall, 100% precision |
| gemma3_optimal (imbalanced) | 0.700 | ~33s | Still best on original data |
| E1_cod_reasoning | 0.500 | ~7s | Faster but lower quality |
| Constrained regex | 0.435 | ~2.3s | Fast but poor accuracy |
| D1_conservative | 0.400 | ~2s | Too conservative |

### Major Findings

1. **Dataset Balance Matters**:
   - Imbalanced dataset (61.5% Same) masked true performance
   - Balanced testing revealed 27% better F1 scores

2. **Optimal Prompts Deliver**:
   - Model-specific formatting crucial
   - XML structure with reasoning works best
   - Research-based approach validated

3. **Speed vs Accuracy Trade-off**:
   - 33s for high accuracy (F1=0.889)
   - 2-7s for moderate accuracy (F1=0.400-0.500)
   - No good middle ground found

4. **Perfect Precision Achieved**:
   - gemma3_optimal: 100% precision
   - No false boundaries (user priority)
   - 80% recall acceptable trade-off

### Technical Achievements

- ✅ Fixed naming bug preventing optimal prompt testing
- ✅ Implemented constrained generation (3 approaches)
- ✅ Created balanced dataset for accurate evaluation
- ✅ Documented comprehensive results
- ✅ Achieved target of high accuracy with minimal false boundaries

### Production Recommendations

**Primary Approach**:
```python
model = "gemma3:latest"
prompt = "gemma3_optimal"  # F1=0.889, 100% precision
response_time = ~33 seconds per page
```

**Alternative (if speed critical)**:
```python
model = "gemma3:latest"
prompt = "E1_cod_reasoning"  # F1=0.500, 7s response
# OR
prompt = "constrained_regex"  # F1=0.435, 2.3s response
```

**Implementation Notes**:
1. Use XML parsing for gemma3_optimal responses
2. Implement caching to offset slow response time
3. Monitor prediction distribution in production
4. Consider batch processing for efficiency

### Next Steps

1. **Immediate**:
   - Implement production LLMDetector with gemma3_optimal
   - Add response caching layer
   - Test on real PDF documents

2. **Short-term**:
   - Create more test cases for edge scenarios
   - Optimize prompt for faster response (if possible)
   - Build confidence scoring system

3. **Long-term**:
   - Train custom model for faster inference
   - Implement hybrid approach with visual/heuristic signals
   - Build feedback loop for continuous improvement

### Lessons Learned

1. **Prompt Engineering Impact**: 0% → 88.9% F1 through systematic optimization
2. **Dataset Quality**: Balanced datasets essential for accurate metrics
3. **Model Differences**: Gemma3 significantly outperforms Phi4
4. **Complexity Worth It**: Optimal prompts justify longer response times
5. **Precision Priority**: 100% precision achievable and valuable

### Conclusion

The experiments successfully identified **gemma3_optimal as the best approach** for LLM-based boundary detection, achieving F1=0.889 with perfect precision. While response time is high (33s), the accuracy justifies its use for critical document processing tasks where false boundaries must be minimized.
