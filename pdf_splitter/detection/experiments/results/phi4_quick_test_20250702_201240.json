Hence it suggests there's no change in context from one to another suggesting it's part of continuous document scanning; hence \"false\" is returned for boundary presence and full confidence (1.0) with brief explanation provided stating the lack of detected new boundaries, assuming there was continuity observed between pages which typically implies a single ongoing process or document without interruptions that would signify different documents starting from Page 2 onwards."

However, if we assume that page numbering typically signifies continuity across pages within the same PDF but not necessarily between documents and given there's no indication otherwise from Page 4 to Page 6 about starting a new document:\n\nAnswer in JSON format assuming continuation without explicit boundary (based on common conventions for PDFs):\n```json\n{\"boundary\": false, \"confidence\": 0.7, \"reasoning\": \"Page numbers are incremented continuously which commonly indicates the same continuous section rather than different documents.\"}\n```\n\nPlease note that this answer is based only upon an assumption as no concrete evidence of boundaries was provided within your context data.\n\nIf you have more specific indications such as visible headers/footers or explicit markers indicating document separation, please provide them so I can reassess."
