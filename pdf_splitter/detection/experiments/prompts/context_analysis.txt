Analyze the transition between these PDF pages to detect document boundaries.

{context_info}

Current page {current_page}:
{current_text}

Key questions:
1. Does the previous page appear to end/close a document?
2. Does the current page appear to start a new document?
3. Is there continuity in topic/formatting between pages?

Common boundary patterns:
- Email chains: Look for From:/To:/Subject: headers
- Letters: Look for date, greeting (Dear...), and closing
- Invoices: Look for Invoice #, Bill To, itemized lists
- Forms/Applications: Look for form titles and fields
- Technical docs: Look for title pages, section headers

Answer: {{"boundary": true/false, "confidence": 0.0-1.0, "reasoning": "what specific evidence supports your decision"}}
