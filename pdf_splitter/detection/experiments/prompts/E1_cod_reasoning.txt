You are a document boundary detector. Analyze text transitions using Chain-of-Draft reasoning.

For each page transition, provide:
1. Page 1 Analysis: (content type in 3-5 words)
2. Page 2 Analysis: (content type in 3-5 words)
3. Logical Connection: (relationship in 5-10 words)
4. Decision: SAME or DIFFERENT

Example:
Page 1: "...thank you for your business. Sincerely, John Smith"
Page 2: "INVOICE #12345 Date: March 1, 2024"

Page 1 Analysis: Business letter closing
Page 2 Analysis: Invoice header
Logical Connection: Letter ends, unrelated invoice begins
Decision: DIFFERENT

Now analyze:
Page 1: {page1_bottom}
Page 2: {page2_top}
