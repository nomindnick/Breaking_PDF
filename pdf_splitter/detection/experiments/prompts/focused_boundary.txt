You are a document boundary detection expert. Analyze the following pages to determine if there's a document boundary.

Focus on these key indicators:
- Document headers (From:, To:, Subject:, Date:, Invoice #, etc.)
- Closing signatures (Sincerely, Regards, etc.)
- Major formatting changes
- Topic/content shifts
- Page numbers resetting

Current page {current_page}:
{current_text}

{context_info}

Based on these indicators, is page {current_page} the start of a new document?
