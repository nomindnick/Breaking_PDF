# OCR Module Improvements Summary

## Problem Identified
The OCR module was achieving only 0.8% F1 score on computer-generated PDFs, despite the PDFs being high quality "print to file" documents.

## Root Causes Found

1. **Low DPI Setting**: Default 150 DPI was too low for accurate OCR
2. **MKLDNN Bug**: `enable_mkldnn=True` was causing garbled text output
3. **Unnecessary Preprocessing**: Computer-generated PDFs don't need aggressive preprocessing

## Improvements Implemented

### 1. Increased Default DPI
```python
# In pdf_splitter/core/config.py
default_dpi: int = Field(300, ge=72, le=600, description="Default DPI for rendering")
```

### 2. Disabled MKLDNN
```python
# In pdf_splitter/preprocessing/ocr_processor.py
paddle_enable_mkldnn: bool = False  # Was True
```

### 3. Smart Preprocessing
```python
# Skip preprocessing for high-quality images
if image_quality > 0.8 and page_type != PageType.MIXED:
    processed_image = image
    warnings.append(f"Skipped preprocessing for high-quality image (quality={image_quality:.2f})")
```

## Results

### Before Improvements
- **Average Word F1 Score**: 0.008 (0.8%)
- **Average Character Accuracy**: 0.003 (0.3%)
- **Processing Time**: 0.33s per page

### After Improvements
- **Average Word F1 Score**: 0.735 (73.5%) ✅ **91x improvement!**
- **Average Character Accuracy**: 0.434 (43.4%) ✅ **144x improvement!**
- **Processing Time**: 2.00s per page (still under target)

### Per-Page Results (First 10 pages)
| Page | Word F1 Score | OCR Words | Truth Words |
|------|---------------|-----------|-------------|
| 1    | 88.8%         | 206       | 222         |
| 2    | 78.4%         | 74        | 87          |
| 3    | 81.4%         | 125       | 125         |
| 4    | 87.5%         | 24        | 24          |
| 5    | 85.9%         | 171       | 179         |
| 6    | 79.7%         | 83        | 97          |
| 7    | 60.8%         | 160       | 191         |
| 8    | 40.1%         | 164       | 256         |
| 9    | 41.8%         | 80        | 167         |
| 10   | 90.1%         | 241       | 240         |

## Key Learnings

1. **MKLDNN Compatibility**: The MKLDNN optimization in PaddleOCR has compatibility issues that can cause severe accuracy degradation
2. **DPI Matters**: 300 DPI is the sweet spot for OCR accuracy on computer-generated PDFs
3. **Less is More**: For high-quality PDFs, preprocessing can actually hurt accuracy
4. **Testing is Critical**: Direct comparison with PaddleOCR helped isolate the configuration issue

## Remaining Issues

While accuracy improved dramatically, some pages (7-9) still have lower accuracy. These appear to be:
- Forms with complex layouts
- Tables with many columns
- Documents with special formatting

## Recommendations

1. **Use these settings for computer-generated PDFs**:
   - DPI: 300
   - MKLDNN: Disabled
   - Preprocessing: Auto-skip for high-quality images

2. **For scanned documents**, consider:
   - Testing if MKLDNN works better
   - Enabling full preprocessing pipeline
   - Using higher DPI (400) for very poor scans

3. **Future improvements**:
   - Implement layout-aware OCR for tables
   - Add special handling for forms
   - Consider using different OCR models for different document types

## Configuration Summary

```python
# Optimal configuration for computer-generated PDFs
pdf_config = PDFConfig(
    default_dpi=300,  # Increased from 150
)

ocr_config = OCRConfig(
    primary_engine=OCREngine.PADDLEOCR,
    preprocessing_enabled=True,  # Smart preprocessing
    paddle_enable_mkldnn=False,  # Critical fix
    max_workers=4,  # Optimal for parallel processing
)
```
