# Visual Detector Implementation - Cleanup Summary

## Documentation Updates Completed ✅

### 1. **development_progress.md**
- Entry #15 already added documenting visual detector completion
- Includes experimental results (F1=0.667 synthetic, F1=0.514 real-world)
- Documents recommendation to use as supplementary signal only
- Performance metrics: ~31ms per page comparison

### 2. **CLAUDE.md**
- Visual Detection marked as complete in "In Progress" section
- Performance metrics added (F1 scores for both synthetic and real-world)
- Updated to show 2 of 3 detectors complete (LLM + Visual)
- Next step noted as Heuristic detector implementation

### 3. **DETECTION_MODULE_STATUS.md**
- Visual Detector moved from "In Progress" to "Completed Components"
- Added full implementation details and performance metrics
- Updated summary to show "2 of 4 detectors complete"
- Clear recommendation for supplementary use only

## Technical Debt Cleanup ✅

### 1. **Archived Experiment Results**
- Moved root-level experiment results to `/experiments/archive/`
- Includes JSON results and threshold analysis plots
- Visual detector experiments already well-organized in its own directory

### 2. **Removed Temporary Files**
- Deleted `htmlcov/` directories (coverage reports)
- Cleaned all `__pycache__` directories
- Removed all `.pyc` files throughout project

### 3. **Directory Structure**
The visual detector maintains a clean structure:
```
visual_detector/
├── visual_detector.py        # Production implementation
├── example_usage.py          # Usage demonstration
├── tests/                    # Comprehensive test suite
├── experiments/              # Experimental framework
│   ├── EXPERIMENT_RESULTS.md # Consolidated results
│   └── archive/              # Historical experiments
└── README.md                 # Module documentation
```

## Key Implementation Highlights

### Production Configuration
```python
VisualDetector(
    voting_threshold=1,    # Sensitive for supplementary role
    phash_threshold=10,    # Optimized thresholds
    ahash_threshold=12,
    dhash_threshold=12,
    hash_size=8           # 64-bit hashes
)
```

### Performance Summary
- **Synthetic Data**: F1=0.667, Precision=50%, Recall=100%
- **Real-World Data**: F1=0.514, Precision=34.6%, Recall=100%
- **Speed**: ~31ms per page (exceeds <500ms requirement)

### Critical Finding
Visual detection cannot reliably distinguish between:
- True document boundaries
- Layout changes within documents
- Style variations (e.g., letterheads)

Therefore, it should only be used as a supplementary signal to boost confidence when combined with semantic detection (LLM-based).

## Next Steps
1. Implement HeuristicDetector for pattern-based detection
2. Create SignalCombiner to integrate all detectors
3. Design confidence aggregation strategy
4. Build integration layer with preprocessing module
