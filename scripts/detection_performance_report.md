# Detection Module Performance Report

## Overview
This report summarizes the performance of the PDF Splitter detection module based on integration testing with the test PDF datasets.

## Test Configuration
- **Test PDF**: Test_PDF_Set_2_ocr.pdf (36 pages, OCR'd)
- **Ground Truth Boundaries**: 14 document boundaries at pages [1, 5, 7, 9, 13, 14, 18, 20, 23, 26, 32, 34, 35, 36]

## Detector Performance Results

### 1. Heuristic Detector
The heuristic detector uses pattern matching and document structure analysis.

**Configuration: Optimized**
- **Precision**: 0.371 (37.1%)
- **Recall**: 0.929 (92.9%)
- **F1 Score**: 0.531
- **Speed**: < 0.001s per page (extremely fast)
- **Boundaries Found**: 35 out of 36 pages flagged as boundaries

**Analysis**:
- Very high recall (finds most real boundaries)
- Low precision (many false positives)
- Almost every page is flagged as a boundary
- Needs tuning to reduce false positives

### 2. Visual Detector
The visual detector uses image hashing and visual similarity analysis.

**Performance**:
- **Precision**: 0.323 (32.3%)
- **Recall**: 0.714 (71.4%)
- **F1 Score**: 0.444
- **Speed**: 0.141s per page
- **Boundaries Found**: 31 boundaries detected

**Analysis**:
- Moderate recall (misses ~29% of boundaries)
- Low precision (many false positives)
- Slower than heuristic but still reasonable speed
- Better suited as a supplementary signal

### 3. LLM Detector
**Status**: Not tested due to Ollama timeout issues
- Known performance from documentation: F1 Score of 0.889
- Requires Ollama service running with gemma3:latest model
- Uses persistent caching for performance optimization

## Key Findings

### Strengths
1. **Heuristic Detector**: Extremely fast with high recall
2. **Visual Detector**: Provides independent signal based on visual changes
3. **Modular Architecture**: Easy to test and evaluate individual detectors

### Areas for Improvement
1. **False Positive Rate**: Both tested detectors have high false positive rates
2. **Heuristic Tuning**: The heuristic detector needs better threshold configuration
3. **LLM Integration**: Need to resolve Ollama timeout issues for production use

## Recommendations

### 1. Immediate Actions
- Tune heuristic detector thresholds to reduce false positives
- Implement better confidence scoring in heuristic detector
- Set up Ollama with proper timeout configuration

### 2. Signal Combination Strategy
Based on the results, recommended approach:
- Use LLM as primary detector (when available)
- Use heuristic as high-recall backup
- Use visual as tie-breaker or confirmation signal
- Implement weighted voting with:
  - LLM: 0.5 weight
  - Heuristic: 0.3 weight  
  - Visual: 0.2 weight

### 3. Performance Optimization
- Current processing speed: ~0.14s per page (visual detector bottleneck)
- Target: < 5s per page âœ“ (already achieved)
- Can process a 100-page document in ~14 seconds

## Test Limitations
1. Only tested on OCR'd PDF (Test_PDF_Set_2_ocr.pdf)
2. LLM detector not tested due to service issues
3. Signal combiner not tested due to detector issues
4. Limited to 36-page test document

## Next Steps
1. Fix heuristic detector to provide meaningful confidence scores
2. Set up proper Ollama configuration for LLM testing
3. Test signal combiner with multiple detector outputs
4. Expand testing to larger document sets
5. Test on non-OCR PDFs with proper OCR pipeline
