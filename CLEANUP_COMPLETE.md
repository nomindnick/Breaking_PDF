# Project Cleanup Summary

## Date: 2025-07-11

### Overview
Cleaned up the Breaking_PDF project after detection module simplification, removing experimental code and organizing documentation.

### Actions Taken

#### 1. Detection Module Cleanup
- Removed all experimental detectors (optimized, balanced, calibrated, etc.)
- Removed complex ensemble and signal combiner code
- Simplified to basic EmbeddingsDetector (F1=0.65-0.70)
- Updated production_detector.py for simple usage

#### 2. Root Directory Cleanup
- Removed temporary analysis files (OCR reports, test outputs)
- Removed coverage reports (htmlcov/)
- Removed analysis directories (analysis_output/, ocr_analysis/)
- Removed cleanup scripts

#### 3. Documentation Organization
- Created `docs/project_history/` for historical documentation
- Moved all analysis and decision documents to history
- Updated README.md to reflect current state
- Updated CLAUDE.md with simplified approach

#### 4. Scripts Directory Cleanup
- Removed test and debug scripts
- Kept only essential utilities:
  - benchmark_ocr_simple.py
  - check_ollama_setup.py
- Updated scripts/README.md

#### 5. Test Data Cleanup
- Removed validation sets that led to overfitting
- Removed diverse test sets created during experimentation
- Kept only original test PDFs and ground truth

### Current State
- Clean, production-ready codebase
- Simple embeddings-based detection (avoiding overfitting)
- All documentation reflects current implementation
- Ready for next phase: Splitting Module

### Key Files Remaining
- Core implementation in pdf_splitter/
- Essential documentation: README.md, CLAUDE.md, development_progress.md
- Original test files in test_files/
- Development plan showing overall vision
- Project history in docs/project_history/

### Next Steps
1. Begin work on Splitting Module
2. Then API Module
3. Finally Frontend Module
