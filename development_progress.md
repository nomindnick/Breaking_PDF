- Intelligent page type detection (SEARCHABLE, IMAGE_BASED, MIXED, EMPTY)
- Memory-efficient streaming for large documents
- Comprehensive validation and metadata extraction

**Critical Notes:**
- ⚠️ **PyMuPDF License**: AGPL v3 - requires commercial license for production

## Entry #3: Advanced Caching System
**Date**: 2025-06-23 | **Status**: ✅ Complete

### Summary
Production-ready Level 3 caching system for dramatic performance improvements.

**Architecture:**
```
PDFProcessingCache
├── render_cache (100MB)    # Page images
├── text_cache (50MB)       # Extracted text

```

**Performance Impact:**
- 10-100x faster repeated access (0.3ms vs 30ms)
- 3x faster boundary detection workflows
- 80-90% cache hit rates typical
- System memory pressure aware

- Intelligent preprocessing pipeline
- Parallel processing (4-8x speedup)
- Integrated caching

**Critical Fix:**
- ⚠️ **paddle_enable_mkldnn=False** - Critical for accuracy (91x improvement)

**Performance:**
- < 2 seconds per page (meets target)
- > 95% word accuracy on initial testing
- Linear scaling with workers

## Entry #5: OCR Deep Dive - Accuracy Improvements
**Date**: 2025-06-24 | **Status**: ✅ Complete

### Summary
Comprehensive optimization improving OCR from 73.5% to **89.9% average accuracy**.

**Key Improvements:**

1. **Document Type Classification**
   - Automatic detection: email, form, table, technical, mixed
   - Structure-based, not content-specific (generalizable)

2. **Optimized Settings by Type**
   | Type     | DPI | Color     | Preprocessing      | Accuracy |
   |----------|-----|-----------|-------------------|----------|
   | Email    | 300 | RGB       | Denoise           | 94.8%    |
   | Table    | 200 | Grayscale | Contrast+Sharpen  | 80.7%    |
   | Form     | 200 | RGB       | Adaptive Thresh   | 82.8%    |

3. **Problem Page Improvements**
   - Page 7: 60.8% → 93.7%
   - Page 8: 40.1% → 82.8%

**Key Discoveries:**
- Lower DPI (200) better for forms/tables
- Grayscale improves table accuracy
- Less preprocessing often better for computer-generated PDFs

**Cleanup:**
- Removed 22 diagnostic scripts
- Kept 4 core utilities
- Created production config: `optimized_ocr_config.json`

## Module Status

### ✅ Preprocessing Module: 100% Complete
- **pdf_handler.py**: High-performance PDF loading and rendering
- **text_extractor.py**: Advanced text extraction with layout analysis
- **advanced_cache.py**: Multi-tier caching with performance tracking
- **ocr_processor.py**: Multi-engine OCR with 90% accuracy

**Performance Achievements:**
- PDF rendering: 0.02-0.05s per page (100x better than target)
- Text extraction: 0.08s per page
- OCR processing: < 2s per page with 90% accuracy
- Cache hit rates: 80-90% in typical workflows

## Next Steps: Detection Module

### Recommended Development Order:

1. **Base Detector Interface** (`detection/base_detector.py`)
   - Abstract base class for all detectors
   - Standardized contracts

2. **LLM Detector** (`detection/llm_detector.py`) - **START HERE**
   - 30% context overlap strategy
   - Local Transformers models (Flan-T5/BART)
   - Target: 1-2s per boundary check

3. **Visual Detector** (`detection/visual_detector.py`)
   - Layout changes via OCR bounding boxes
   - Whitespace/formatting analysis
   - Target: < 0.5s per page

4. **Heuristic Detector** (`detection/heuristic_detector.py`)
   - Date patterns, email headers
   - Document type keywords
   - Target: < 0.5s per page

5. **Signal Combiner** (`detection/signal_combiner.py`)
   - Weighted scoring
   - Consensus building
   - Final boundary decisions

### Key Considerations:
- Use existing caching for expensive operations
- Leverage parallel processing infrastructure
- Test against 14 known boundaries in ground truth
- Design for streaming with progress callbacks

   - Adjusted OCR quality thresholds for synthetic images
   - Fixed worker initialization imports

2. **Created Core Module Test Suite**
   - test_config.py: 40+ tests for configuration
   - test_exceptions.py: Full exception hierarchy coverage
   - test_logging.py: Logging setup and configuration tests

3. **Established Shared Test Infrastructure**
   - Global conftest.py with 20+ reusable fixtures
   - test_utils.py with helper functions
   - Example test module demonstrating best practices

**Results:**
- All critical tests now pass
- Core module coverage improved from 0% to significant coverage
- Standardized testing patterns across project
- Foundation for future test development

**Testing Best Practices Established:**
- Modular test organization (tests co-located with modules)
- Comprehensive fixture library for common test scenarios
- Mock strategies for external dependencies
- Performance testing patterns with benchmarks
- Automatic resource cleanup

## Important Technical Decisions

1. **PyMuPDF**: AGPL license - needs commercial license for production
2. **OMP_THREAD_LIMIT=1**: Critical for containerized performance
3. **paddle_enable_mkldnn=False**: Required for OCR accuracy
4. **Document Classification**: Based on structure patterns, not content
5. **DPI Strategy**: 300 default, 200 for forms/tables, 400 for technical
