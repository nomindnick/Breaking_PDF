## Entry #10: Detection Module - Experimental Approach
**Date**: 2025-07-03 | **Status**: 🚧 In Progress

### Summary
Started detection module with an experimental approach, focusing on making LLM detection "rock solid" before implementing other detection signals.

**Philosophy Alignment:**
Following the project's core principle of ensuring each component is thoroughly tested and optimized before moving forward. Rather than implementing all detectors at once, we're taking an experimental approach to find the optimal LLM configuration first.

   - 97% test coverage with 16 passing tests

2. **Experimentation Framework**
   - `experiment_runner.py`: Core framework with Ollama integration
   - Support for multiple strategies:
     - **context_overlap**: Sliding window with configurable overlap (20%, 30%, 40%)
     - **type_first**: Classify document type, then detect boundaries
     - **chain_of_thought**: Step-by-step reasoning for better accuracy
     - **multi_signal**: Placeholder for future integration
   - Comprehensive metrics tracking (precision, recall, F1, latency)
   - Results persistence and comparison tools

3. **CLI Tool** (`run_experiments.py`)
   - Easy experimentation with different models and strategies
   - Automatic PDF processing and ground truth loading
   - Batch testing and results comparison

**Initial Experiments:**
- Models to test: Llama3 (8B), Gemma3, Phi4-mini (3.8B), Phi3-mini
- Prompt templates created:
  - Default: Basic boundary detection
  - `focused_boundary.txt`: Emphasizes specific document markers
  - `context_analysis.txt`: Detailed transition analysis

**Key Technical Decisions:**
1. **Ollama over Transformers**: More flexibility for testing different models
2. **Experimental First**: Validate approach before production implementation
3. **Multiple Strategies**: Test various approaches to find optimal configuration
4. **Comprehensive Metrics**: Track accuracy, latency, and consistency

**Next Steps:**
1. Run experiments with all available models
2. Test different overlap percentages and window sizes
3. Optimize prompts based on results
4. Implement production LLM detector with best configuration
5. Then proceed with visual and heuristic detectors

**Success Criteria:**
- **Accuracy**: > 95% F1 score on test set
- **Latency**: < 2 seconds per boundary check
- **Consistency**: Low variance across runs
- **Robustness**: Handle various document types

## Entry #13: LLM Detector Optimization & Caching
**Date**: 2025-07-08 | **Status**: ✅ Complete

### Summary
Optimized LLM detector with persistent caching system and simplified architecture based on code review feedback.

**Key Changes Made:**
1. **Persistent SQLite Caching**
   - 33,000x performance improvement for cached responses
   - Stores page text pairs → LLM responses
   - 30-day expiration, 500MB size limit
   - Automatic cleanup and size management

2. **Simplified Architecture**
   - Removed duplicate BatchedLLMDetector module
   - Removed configuration presets (fast, balanced, accurate)
   - Restored 15-line default for consistency
   - Fixed all failing tests

3. **Enhanced Configuration**
   - Environment variable support (LLM_CACHE_ENABLED, etc.)
   - Configuration file loading (JSON/YAML)
   - Runtime parameter validation

**Cache Implementation Details:**
```python
# Cache key: SHA256(page1_text)[:16] + SHA256(page2_text)[:16] + model + version
# Storage: SQLite with metadata (confidence, reasoning, timestamps)
# Lookup: O(1) with index on key
```

**Production Use Case Analysis:**
- **Primary benefit**: Retry scenarios (failed splits, errors)
- **Secondary benefit**: Reprocessing same PDFs
- **Limited benefit**: One-time PDF splitting (core use case)
- **Recommendation**: Keep enabled for robustness, minimal overhead

**Testing Considerations:**
- Cache interferes with testing - returns cached results
- Solutions implemented:
  - `cache_enabled=False` parameter
  - `detector.clear_cache()` method
  - `LLM_CACHE_ENABLED=false` environment variable
  - Test fixtures with temporary/disabled caches

**Performance Metrics:**
- First run: ~3-4s per page pair (Ollama API call)
- Cached run: <0.001s per page pair
- Cache overhead: ~50-100ms total per document
- Storage: ~1KB per cached response

**Future Optimization Ideas:**
1. **Prompt Caching**: Currently not feasible with Ollama
   - Each request processes full prompt (inefficient)
   - Would need custom LLM server or different architecture
   - Potential solutions: vLLM, TGI, or custom inference server

2. **Context Caching**: For future investigation
   - Cache prompt embeddings/attention states
   - Requires deeper LLM integration
   - Could reduce processing by 30-50%

**Key Takeaways:**
- Caching provides safety net for production failures
- Testing requires cache awareness and management
- Simplified architecture reduces technical debt
- Performance targets met even without batching
